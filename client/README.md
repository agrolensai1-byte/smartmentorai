SkillEdge Client (Vite + React)

Quick start
1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd client
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. The client expects the server running at `http://localhost:4000` for API routes (see `server/`).

Notes
- This is a minimal React client; extend pages and wire offline sync with Dexie as next steps.
